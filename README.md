# React Firebase Starter Project.

This project was bootstrapped with
[Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

You will need to create a [Firebase project](https://firebase.google.com/).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br> Open
[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br> You will also see any lint errors in
the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br> See the section
about
[running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests)
for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br> It correctly bundles
React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br> Your app is
ready to be deployed!

**Uses the production .env variables when initializing Firebase.**

See the section about
[deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for
