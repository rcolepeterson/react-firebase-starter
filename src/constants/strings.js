export const ABOUT = `The Town Hall app is used for crowd sourcing questions to be asked in a town hall setting.<br /><br />

  Before a company meeting, users can submit questions and vote on other user's questions.<br />
  The questions are displayed in a leader board and can be sorted by the associated number of votes.<br />
  The moderator or admin for the meeting can then submit the questions with the most votes to the speaker to be answered.<br /><br />
  
  Hopefully by collecting questions and allowing users to vote ahead of time, the end result will be a meeting covering topics people really care about. <br /><br />
  
  All questions and voting is done in real time. <br />
  Meaning users will be able to see the question vote counts go up and down as people vote as well as new questions being asked in real time.<br /><br />

  Contact <a href="mailto:cole.peterson@possible">cole.peterson@possible.com</a> with any issues.
